This project assumes that a local gamestore wants to have a Commander tounament some time in the future.
As such to make creating a pod of players per table easier the store will ask the players what colors the deck is running, the player's name, and what their deck's "power level" is.

these valus are assinged to a database and once entered allow the store to see these attributes and assign players to talbes or "pods" manually depending on power level
